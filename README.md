# Manual Testing Project

## Project Title
**OPEN_CART** & **CURA_HEALTHCARE_SERVICES** 

---

## Project Description

This repository contains the complete documentation for the manual testing of a web application - **OPEN_CART** & **CURA_HEALTHCARE_SERVICES** . The goal of this project is to ensure the quality and functionality of the application through rigorous manual testing methods. The project includes various testing processes, such as functional, UI/UX, compatibility, and security testing. Manual testing is a critical part of ensuring that the web application is user-friendly, functional, and secure.

In this project, we perform tests without using any automation tools, focusing on detecting errors and improving the application's performance and user experience.

## Testing Documents

The following testing documents are included in this repository:

1. **Test Plan**  
   A high-level document that outlines the scope, objectives, strategy, and resources for the manual testing process.  

2. **Test Cases**  
   A detailed list of test cases that cover the application's features, functional requirements, and various scenarios. Each test case includes test steps, expected results, and execution status.  

3. **Bug Reports**  
   A collection of bugs and issues identified during the manual testing process, including severity, steps to reproduce, and the current status of each issue.  

4. **Test Case Report**  
   A Test case document provides an overview of the testing process, including the total number of test cases executed, pass/fail rates, and key issues discovered.

5. **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)**
   A requirement Traceability Matrix is a document which is created to trace Test scenario and the test case associated with that scenario so that we can check the status of that test case and test scenario.

## Testing Tools and Methodologies

### Tools Used:

- **JIRA**: For tracking bugs and managing tasks.
- **Google Sheets / Excel**: For documenting and managing test cases and execution logs.
- **Browser Developer Tools**: For debugging web application issues on different browsers.
- **Postman** (if applicable): For manually testing APIs.

### Testing Methodologies:

1. **Exploratory Testing**: Testers explore the application to find defects without predefined test cases. This helps to uncover unexpected issues and gain insights into the user experience.
   
2. **Regression Testing**: After any code changes or bug fixes, regression testing is performed to ensure existing features still function correctly.

3. **Functional Testing**: Verifying that the web application functions as expected and meets the business requirements. This involves testing individual features like user registration, login, search, and payment processing.

4. **Usability Testing**: Focuses on evaluating the user experience (UX) and interface (UI) to ensure that the application is intuitive and easy to use.

5. **Security Testing**: Manual checks to identify potential security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).

6. **Compatibility Testing**: Verifying that the application works seamlessly across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), and devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops).

## Conclusion

Manual testing plays an essential role in verifying the functionality, usability, and security of the web application. Throughout this project, we have successfully identified several bugs, UI inconsistencies, and security issues. The test results will be used to improve the overall quality of the application, ensuring it meets user expectations and business requirements.

### Key Findings:

- Multiple UI issues across different browsers need to be addressed to maintain consistency.
- Some security vulnerabilities were discovered, including weak input validation and lack of HTTPS support.
- Overall user experience improvements are needed, particularly in navigation and responsiveness.

By continuing to iterate through the testing phases and applying the feedback, we aim to ensure the web application is robust, secure, and provides a seamless user experience.
