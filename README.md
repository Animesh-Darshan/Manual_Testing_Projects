# Manual_Testing_Projects
In this repository I have uploaded 2 projects which is completely based on manual testing and the testing is done on two different website.
In this manual testing project I had created test scenario document in which I wrote all the possible test scenarios which can be tested.
After creation of test scenario I created a test case document in which I wrote all the test cases in a detailed format.
Then I did test execution inorder to check each test cases and created a test execution report.
After test executon I found some of the bugs so, for that I had created a bug report
